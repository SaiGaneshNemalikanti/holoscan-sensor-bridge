- Preliminary version of "Bring your own driver" for V4L2 kernel-mode camera drivers.

To use this, in the host system:
- cd drivers
- make
- sudo insmod ./hololink_i2c.ko
- sudo insmod ./hololink_camera.ko i2c_bus_number=16 i2c_device_address=0x1A
- echo "IMX274 0x1A" | sudo tee /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-16/new_device

In the container:
- python3 examples/linux_camera_player.py

Then, in the host system, you can:
- v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video1 --all
- v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video1 --set-ctrl exposure=10000
- v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video1 --set-ctrl test_pattern=11

To enable trace-level debugging,
- sudo dmesg -w &
and enable tracing either at load time:
- sudo insmod ./hololink_i2c.ko trace=1
- sudo insmod ./hololink_camera.ko i2c_bus_number=16 i2c_device_address=0x1A trace=1
or after it's been loaded, at run time:
- echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/module/hololink_i2c/parameters/trace
- echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/module/hololink_camera/parameters/trace

Assumptions/To do:
- Instructions here assume that hololink_i2c.ko sets up I2C device 16
- Instructions here assume that the video device is /dev/video1
- Synchronization around I2C transactions is not provided
- Only one camera instance as currently been tested
- Camera connections, dimensions, and image configuration are currently hardcoded into examples/linux_camera_player.py; we'll update this to read these parameters from the driver
